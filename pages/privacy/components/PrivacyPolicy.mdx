# WalkingPal Safety and Policy Center

## Our Commitment:

We take the safety, security, and well-being of our users very seriously. As the app tries to encourage more people to walk, we take pride in connecting millions of people every day. While a relatively small percentage of these connections have led to users falling victim to criminal activity, we firmly believe any incident of misconduct or criminal behavior is one too many.

We are continuously exploring new updates, partnerships, and technologies to enhance and inform our safety efforts while fostering a respectful environment for walking. Information about our safety tools and practices can be found below. Whether you’re in Santa Monica, São Paulo, or Seoul—our goal remains the same: a safe and positive experience for users on our platform.

## Our Safety Tools:

We utilize a network of industry-leading automated and manual moderation and review tools, systems, and processes—and invest significant resources—to prevent, monitor, and remove inappropriate behavior (impersonation, harassment, and more) from our app.

These tools include automatic scans of profiles for red-flag language and images; manual reviews of suspicious profiles, activity, and user-generated reports; shadow-banning suspicious accounts; as well as blocking of email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, and other identifiers associated with bad actors.

We have a zero-tolerance policy on harassment and encourage our community to report any instance of misconduct and/or anyone who violates our Community Guidelines or Terms of Use, via the self-reporting tool featured on all WalkingPal profiles or by contacting our team online. In the event that we receive such a report, our dedicated community team takes appropriate measures, which may include removing the content, banning the user, or notifying the appropriate law enforcement resources.

We are constantly evaluating and refining our processes, and will always work with law enforcement, where possible, to protect our users.

## Response to Reports of Assault:

WalkingPal users can easily report instances of abuse or assault in-app or online. We strongly encourage any user who believes they have been a victim of a crime to report it to law enforcement. Our team works to promptly investigate reported crimes, assess and take appropriate action, and fully cooperate with law enforcement in any investigation.

When a user reports an assault to WalkingPal, we attempt to identify the alleged perpetrator and block the associated account. The incident is then reported to our Support Team's centralized safety repository and checked across our various fields to see if the user has other accounts on other platforms. If any are found, they are blocked as well.

## User Education:

We offer safety tips, both online and via the app, to educate and empower users to make smart and safe choices while interacting on WalkingPal.

## Government Relations and Legislative Work:

We understand that it’s our responsibility to play a role in defining the standards for the entire industry—which is why we support our team's efforts to work closely with legislators and regulators across the world to define and pass new safety-focused laws that can help make both our users and those on other tech platforms safe. Our team is actively working with several States to promote legislation to help combat catfishing.

We welcome the opportunity to work with governments around the world to make the Internet a safer place for everyone.

## Fraud:

We take the issue of fraud very seriously at WalkingPal. We have a zero-tolerance policy on predatory behavior of any kind. We have a dedicated fraud team that utilizes a network of industry leading technology that scans for fraud and reviews each and every member profile for offensive or inappropriate language, and
