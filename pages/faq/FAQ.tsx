			<>
				WalkingPal scans all the nearby people that are in need of a walking
				buddy, and it connects you with your nearest walking buddy going towards
				the same direction and destination as you.
				<br />
				<strong>P.S.</strong> We won’t be sharing your exact destination with
				anyone for obvious security reasons.

		desc: (
			<>
				We have listed below the steps that we are taking to ensure your safety:
				<ul>
					<li>ID verification of every user.</li>
					<li>
						We will be tracking your whole journey once you get connected with a
						walking buddy, and you can also share you live location to your
						friends and family as well to be extra safe.
					</li>
					<li>
						After you start walking with your walking buddy there will be an SOS
						bubble pop up on the screen (kind of like a messenger bubble). If
						you are in danger or in an uncomfortable position you can just tap
						on that bubble and a notification will be sent to all your emergency
						contacts and to us as well and we will try our best to help you out
						in every possible way.
					</li>
