### Key Takeaways

- difference between subtitle variant and body variant:
  - Both might look same (same size or same font) but there is little difference other than font weight, i.e, Subtitle should be short (few words) whereas body variant can be as long as you want
- Subtitles are not headlines, they are small size text but dark colored for more emphasis
