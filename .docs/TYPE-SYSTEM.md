There is a total of 13 font variants which are shown below in decreasing order of emphasis:

- h1
- h2
- h3
- h4
- h5
- h6
- subtitle1
- subtitle2
- body1
- body2
- button
- caption
- overline

**h1..6** are used for heading. Larger fonts like h1 are used rarely.
**subtitle1..2**: Smaller than headlines. Used for medium-emphasis text that is shorter in length.
**body1..2** Used for long-form writing.
**button** Button text variant is a style applied to the text on buttons.
**Caption and overline**: Used sparingly to annotate imagery.
**overline**: Sparingly used. Mainly Used over headlines to introduce the headline.

### Key Takeaways

- The difference between subtitle variant and body variant:
  - Both might look the same (same size or same font) but there is little difference other than font weight, i.e, the subtitle should be short (few words) whereas the body variant can be as long as you want.
- Subtitles are not headlines, they are small-size text but dark-colored for more emphasis.
